# Text-Editor

I created a text editor that incorporated commands such as moving the cursor around, creating new lines, backspacing text, undo, redo, etc. The most difficult part of this project was preventing memory leaks, especially when implementing the undo and redo commands.

**Possible Commands:**
* Insert Character (Enter any printable character)
* Move cursor right (Ctrl + L)
* Move cursor left (Ctrl + J)
* Move cursor up (Ctrl + I)
* Move cursor down (Ctrl + K)
* Backspace (Ctrl + O)
* Create new line (Ctrl + N)
* Delete line (Ctrl + B)
* Cursor Home (Ctrl + H)
* Cursor End (Ctrl + U)
* Undo (Ctrl + Z)
* Redo (Ctrl + Y)
* Quit (Ctrl + Q)
